# JqueryFormatDateTimeRails

A port of jquery.formatDateTime for rails.
https://github.com/agschwender/jquery.formatDateTime

Made at v1.1.6 (commit b5f9630a1d1b7a838456ae263840d4ac4461a9a8)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jquery_format_date_time_rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jquery_format_date_time_rails

Then, add the following to your app's application.js
```ruby
//= require jquery_format_date_time_rails
```

## Usage

Use in your views like you would normally use the plugin. This just creates a smaller footprint.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake false` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
